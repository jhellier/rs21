        The Demographics Filter allows you to select any demographic slice of the ABQ population
        and see the makeup of all the ABQ neighborhoods. You can combine selections 
        across most slices. Your selections will appear on the upper right corner of
        the map. The map will reflect the selections you have made by the change in 
        color for each neighborhood. The darker the color the higher the count. 
        Except for the Median Age slice, all values are the number of people for 
        that slice.

        At any time you can clear the selections and start with a new 
        investigation. You can click on any colored section to see the makeup of that
        section. Since the popup stays open you can compare the makeup of the section against the Facebook checkins
        or the Twitter tweets by mousing over either.

        The Facebook data is a collection of Checkins for businesses in ABQ. The checkins show where someone has been. The more checkins for a business the more likely it is popular.

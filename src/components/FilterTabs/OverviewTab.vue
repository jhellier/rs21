        Letâ€™s see Albuquerque! In a highly interactive space, we allow you to explore neighborhoods to see who lives there, what places they frequent and what they have to say about life, the universe and everything.

        This section is the primary controller for navigating 
        the app where you can toggle views showing all the tweets 
        for a certain time period, the Facebook checkins for local 
        businesses or drill down into who lives where. The tabbed 
        sections correspond to different data sets: Bernallilo County
        Demographics, Facebook Checkins and Twitter Feeds.  By 
        clicking on any one tab you can explore what the data has 
        to offer and how it is potentially connected to data in the other data sets.
